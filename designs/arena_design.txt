Pokemon Arena Class Design

The arena object will allow the player to battle a computer opponent
The object will have two player objects - you and the computer
and dictionary of the available pokemon as keys and their stats as values.

The arena will allow the player to login to their pokedex and build their battle roster, consisting of 3 pokemon.
The opponent will randomly select 3 pokemon from an available list of pokemon.

Each pokemon will have associated HP, attack, defense, and speed. These values will be used
in the battle mechanics to calculate which side attacks first and how much damage is dealt.
Although each pokemon has a move list, for this demonstration the attack function will be more limited
in scope, not assigning different stats to each move. The attack mechanic will use this function

Damage = 15 * (Attack of Current)/(Defense of Opponent) * Type Effectiveness * Random 

The player and opponent will have 3 battle options
 - attack
 - heal
 - swap
