Pokemon Class Design

The pokemon class will essentially be just a container to hold
attributes of the object, no methods will be accessed via this class

The pokemon class will be built using a user inputed text file
version of their "Pokedex" this list of pokemon objects will then 
be used as an attribute of the pokedex class object itself.

Practically all the programs functionality will be contained in the pokedex.

The driver will contain some basic features to make using the pokedex a 
user friendly experience.

Class:

Pokemon
    attributes: 
            dex num
            name
            type
            moves list
